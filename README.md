- code --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
    -   uhh some command to run VSCode with to avoid getting this error:
        - libdecor-gtk-WARNING: Failed to initialize GTK
          Failed to load plugin 'libdecor-gtk.so': failed to init
- Apparently vscode defaults to using X11 protocol instead of wayland

- OOOR run the executable from the terminal
